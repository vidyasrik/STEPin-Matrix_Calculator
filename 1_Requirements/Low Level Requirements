* User must specify the size of the matrix. The size specified is the dimensions of the square matrix
* Addition of two matrices can be done (1). Both the matrices need to be of same size(2). The size entered in the begining is same for both the matrices
* Subtraction of two matrices is implemented in the same manner as addition
* Multiplication of two matrices is done on two square matrices of a specified size
* The determinant of a single matrix of a specified size is implemented
* The transpose of a single matrix operation is implemented
* To find the inverse of a matrix, both the determinant function and the transpose functions are used in it. The condition that a matrix is invertible is to check if the determinant of the matrix is equal to 0.
